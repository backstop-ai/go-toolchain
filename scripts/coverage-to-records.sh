# go-toolchain coverage convert script (SPEC-042 REQ-007/CLM-021; ISSUE-045).
# PARSE-ONLY: reads the PRODUCER's enriched Go `-coverprofile` on stdin and emits
# per-FILE coverage-records JSON on stdout — NOT SARIF. It runs SANDBOXED (a deny-all
# sandbox-exec profile) and therefore has NO toolchain or project access: it runs NO
# `go` command and reads NO go.mod. All the Go/toolchain knowledge it needs arrives as
# PLAIN-TEXT comment lines the un-sandboxed producer (scripts/coverage-produce.sh)
# folded into the profile: `#backstop-module <M>` and `#backstop-gofile <import-path>`.
# The producer/convert split is what keeps this convert toolchain-free (ISSUE-045).
#
# Go profile line shape:  path:startLine.col,endLine.col numStmt count
# Per FILE: total   = sum(numStmt) over the file's blocks
#           covered = sum(numStmt) over blocks whose count > 0
# A file whose blocks are all 0-statement aggregates to total==0 (the N/A cell) —
# never coerced to a 0% value. Every file present in the profile is `measured: true`,
# and a record is emitted for measured-and-PASSING files too (not only shortfalls),
# so the consumer can distinguish measured-and-passed from not-measured. Metric is
# stamped "statement" (Go's -coverprofile granularity).
#
# REPO-RELATIVE PATHS (ISSUE-045 CLM-005): Go's -coverprofile ALWAYS names files by
# their full module import path (e.g. github.com/bmanson/backstop-core/embed.go),
# never repo-relative. This convert PARSES the producer's `#backstop-module` line and
# strips the "<module>/" import-path prefix so the emitted record `path` is repo-
# relative (embed.go, pkg/pack/engine/registry.go, ...) — the contract the language-
# neutral gate consumer relies on for EXACT path matching, especially root-package
# files whose gate-scope path is a bare basename and cannot be reconciled by a suffix
# scan without colliding with same-basename nested files. A path lacking the prefix
# (or an absent module line) passes through unchanged.
#
# ZERO-STATEMENT N/A RECORDS (ISSUE-045 case-1, CLM-001): a Go source file with zero
# measurable statements (types/consts/interfaces only, e.g. fieldcontract.go) yields
# ZERO lines in a -coverprofile, so it is simply ABSENT from the profile — the
# language-neutral gate would then flag it `coverage_unmeasured` (nothing measured).
# It is NOT unmeasured, it is UN-MEASURABLE-by-construction (N/A). `go test
# -coverprofile` instruments EVERY statement of a package under test, so a MEASURED
# package emits a block for every statement-bearing file; the ONLY files absent from a
# measured package's profile entries are zero-statement files. So this convert emits a
# total:0 N/A record for exactly those: a producer-listed `#backstop-gofile` that
# (a) is ABSENT from the profile AND (b) belongs to a package that HAS >=1 profile
# entry (was measured). An untested-with-statements file already appears in the profile
# (total>0/covered=0) and stays flagged below-threshold; a file in an UNMEASURED
# package (no profile entries) gets NO total:0 record and correctly fires
# coverage_unmeasured. The gate's EXISTING `Total==0 => N/A` guard then handles the
# emitted records with no gate change and no cross-language unsoundness (a gate-side
# "no record in a measured directory => N/A" proxy is UNSOUND across languages — an
# lcov producer OMITS an untested-but-has-statements file — which is why this
# language-specific distinction lives HERE in the pack, not in the gate).
#
# Implemented in POSIX awk (no gawk-only features) so it runs under the macOS system
# awk inside the sandbox. A converter banner on stderr exercises clean-stdout capture.
